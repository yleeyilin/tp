## Features
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `[parameter]` are the parameter values to be keyed in by you.<br>
  For instance, in `/add-staff ; name : [name]`, you will need to key in a value for the `[name]` parameter. <br>
  For example, the actual command that you may input can be `/add-staff ; name : Poochie`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  For instance, if the command specifies `address : [address] ; phone : [phone]`, `phone : [phone] ; address : [address]` is also equivalent.

* You should be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to PoochPlanner. 

* You should take caution when entering the commands as commands are space-sensitive.<br>
  For instance, both ` ; address : ` and ` ; phone : ` are correctly spaced prefixes.  <br> 
  Make sure that all prefixes that you have keyed in contain the correct spacing format. <br>

### Saving the data

Data in your PoochPlanner is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that modifies the data. You will not need to save any data manually.

### Editing the data file

Data in your PoochPlanner is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/poochplanner.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing their `poochplanner.json` file.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**<br>

Manually editing the JSON file is not advised and should be taken with extreme caution.<br>If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, your PoochPlanner may discard all data and start with an empty data file on the next run. <br>Hence, it is recommended that you make a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

**A**: You can open a command line and type `java -version`. If you do not have Java installed, you can install Java 11 using the Oracle guide [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11). Alternatively, you can install the OpenJDK version. For macOS users, you may wish to follow the instructions [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Loading Data from Another Computer

**Q**: How can I transfer my PoochPlanner contacts to another computer?<br>
**A**: You can install PoochPlanner in your target computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PoochPlanner by copying the contents of the `poochplanner.json` file from your current computer and pasting it inside the `poochplanner.json` file of your target computer.

### Using PoochPlanner

**Q**: What are the available commands in PoochPlanner?<br>
**A**: Please refer to our [Command Summary](#command-summary) for the list of available commands.

**Q**: Do I need an internet connection to use PoochPlanner?<br>
**A**: All of PoochPlanner’s functionality can be used offline! No internet connection is required.

**Q**: How do I save my data?<br>
**A**: Data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

**Q**: If I have a lot of contacts, is there a way for me to access my most frequently used contacts easily?<br>
**A**: Yes! You may wish to keep your most important contacts at the top of your contacts list. With our `pin` feature, PoochPlanner ensures that you are always to see them!<br><br>The syntax for the `pin` command is as follows:

`/pin ; name : [name]`

**Q**: How can I remove a contact's rating?<br>
**A**: In PoochPlanner, a `0` rating corresponds to a non-rating (no rating is provided). Therefore, to remove a contact's rating, simply give the target contact a rating of `0`.<br><br>The syntax for the `rate` command is as follows:

`/rate ; name : [name] ; rating : [rating]`

**Q**: Can I append a note to a contact when creating it?<br>
**A**: Yes you can! In fact, you may also rate a contact at its time of creation. Simply append the `; note :` prefix, and you should be on your way!<br><br>
Example: Adding a new contact with a note and a rating

`/add-person ; name : Pooch ; phone : 98883888 ; address : Pooch Street 32 ; email : impooch@gmail.com ; rating : 3 ; note : Hello my name is Pooch! `
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move PoochPlanner to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by your PoochPlanner before running PoochPlanner again.


## Prefix Summary

A **prefix** is an integral construct of PoochPlanner's commands that allow PoochPlanner to uniquely identify contact fields.

| Prefix           | Field                                                       | Contact Type   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
