## Features

### Core Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `[parameter name]` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  For example, `/add-staff ; name : [name]`, `[name]` is a parameter to be supplied by the user.
  The actual command that the user inputs can be `/add-staff ; name : Poochie`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `address : [address] ; phone : [phone]`, `phone : [phone] ; address : [address]` is also acceptable.

* All command words are case-sensitive.<br>
  e.g. if the command word specifies `/add`, then `/ADD` is invalid.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Pooch Planner data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/PoochPlanner.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**<br>

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, PoochPlanner will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the PoochPlanner to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

If you do not have Java installed, you can install Java 11 using the Oracle guide [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11). Alternatively, you can install the OpenJDK version. For macOS users, you may wish to follow the instructions [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html).

### Loading Data from Another Computer

**Q**: How can I transfer my PoochContacts to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install PoochPlanner in your target computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PoochPlanner home folder by copying the contents of the `PoochPlanner.json` file from your current computer and pasting it inside the `PoochPlanner.json` file of your target computer.

### Using PoochPlanner

**Q**: What are the available commands in PoochPlanner?<br>
**A**: Please refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) for the list of available commands.

**Q**: Do I need an internet connection to use PoochPlanner?<br>
**A**: All of PoochPlanner’s functionality can be used offline! No internet connection is required.

**Q**: How do I save my data?<br>
**A**: Data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

**Q**: If I have a lot of PoochContacts, is there a way for me to access my most frequently used PoochContacts easily?<br>
**A**: Yes! You may wish to make use of our `pin` feature, which keeps all of your pinned contacts at the very top of your PoochContact list, ensuring that you are always able to see them!<br><br>The syntax for the `pin` command is as follows:
```
/pin ; name : [name]
```

**Q**: How can I remove a PoochContact's rating?<br>
**A**: In PoochPlanner, a `0` rating corresponds to a non-rating (no rating is provided). Therefore, to remove a PoochContact's rating, simply give the target PoochContact a rating of `0`.<br><br>The syntax for the `rate` command is as follows:
```
/rate ; name : [name] ; rating : [rating]
```

**Q**: Can I append a note to a PoochContact when creating it?<br>
**A**: Yes you can! In fact, you may also rate PoochContacts at their time of creation. Simply enter their respective [prefixes](#prefix-summary) and you should be on your way!<br><br>
Example: Adding a new contact with a note and a rating
```
/add-person ; name : Pooch ; phone : 98883888 ; address : Pooch Street 32 ; email : impooch@gmail.com ; rating : 3 ; note : Hello my name is Pooch!
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
