### Project: PoochPlanner

PoochPlanner is a desktop application to track details of various groups (person, supplier, maintainer, staff) that dog cafe owners have to regularly interact with. The app is optimised for use using Command Line Interface (CLI) while still encompassing a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Help Command - Added the ability to give help to users regarding commands.
    * What it does: Returns the user a help window with the correct command format for a specific command or a general help window.
    * Justification: This feature is crucial for first time users who are unfamiliar to the commands.

* **New Feature**: Note Command - Added the ability to add notes to contacts. 
    * What it does: Adds notes to contacts. These notes have an optional deadline field.
    * Justification: This feature allows dog cafe owners to remember any small detail about their contacts.
    * Highlights: This feature allows optional deadline fields so cafe owners can remember their appointments and not miss a deadline.

* **New Feature**: Remind Command - Added the ability to view reminders.
    * What it does: Displays all contacts with note deadlines from today onwards.
    * Justification: This feature allows dog cafe owners to be reminded of their upcoming deadlines.
